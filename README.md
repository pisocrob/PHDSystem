# Current state
Currently not in a running state. Mid re-factor

# Model
Currently consists of only one file which contains all re-factored database calls. May split this into various files if it seems more practical.

# View
As far as the files that I have been working on are concerned, I think more may need to be removed from them. Need intergrating with Mini's example layout if we want to use that.

# Controller
Next push will see individual controller files added for the applicant pages I have been working on.
