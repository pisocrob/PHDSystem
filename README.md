# Current state
Application pages working. Edit and delete methods added, need to write the calls for these.
Login view and controller exist. NEXT STEP: do the appropriate checks when methods are called based on session data.

NB: This login is insecure and sketchy, only designed to demonstrate usage.

# Model
Still using a single file for all functions. Might split them off at the end.

# View
Working inside Mini's headers and footers and using Mini's buttons - needs AJAX implementing
Needs merging with Matt's work for the split view files

# Controller
addapplicant controller almost fully functional. Needs renaming
login controller exists, needs testing.
